    Welcome to the Gemini book summariser. Upload your EPUB book and the app will handle everything for you :)

    * This web app takes your uploaded EPUB book, converts it to the Markdown format, and then submits it to Google Gemini for summarisation
    * GitHub repository available [here](https://github.com/Ze1598/epub_to_summary)
    * Your uploaded files within the web app are only kept during summarisation. All intermediary files generated are deleted upon completion, including deletion of files Gemini-side
